## Get started!


## HUGE!

Styles and scripts building, media transformation, self-loaded fonts and SEO in the configuration. Hugo is even more declarative with HUGE.

Even though Hugo handles a lot from configuration, most of its new main features (pipes, js.build, image transformation) do not. HUGE aligns their ease of use with other features of Hugo so users don't have to educate themselves about their API and focus on what matters: HTML, Javascript, CSS.

To know more about its amazing feature, read the announcement [here](https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/introducing-huge-a-hugo-framework/), head straight to the [WIKI](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/huge/wiki), or jump right in with the a starter!
